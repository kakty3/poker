Hand history parsing API
========================


.. note:: Hand history parsing API will change for sure until 1.0 is done.


Constant values
---------------

These enumerations are used to identify common values like limit types, game, etc.
By unifying these into groups of enumeration classes, it's possible to have common values
accross the whole framework, even when parsing totally different kind of hand histories, which
uses different values. (`Data normalization`_)
It's recommended to use keys (name property) to save in database, and print them to the user.
(E.g. in a web application template, ``{{ PokerRoom.STARS }}`` will be converted to ``'PokerStars'``.)

.. automodule:: poker.constants

Base classes

                                           this extra attribute will not be included. default value is None

.. autoclass:: poker.handhistory._Player

                              None for players didn't show... autoclass:: poker.handhistory._Player


Every hand history has an attribute ``flop`` which is an instance of the room specific :class:`_Flop`
object which has the following attributes:

.. currentmodule:: None

.. class:: _Flop

   :ivar tuple cards:          tuple of :class:`poker.card.Card`\ s
   :ivar decimal.Decimal pot:  pot size after actions
   :ivar tuple players:        tuple of player names
   :ivar tuple actions:        | tuple of :class:`poker.constants.Action` in the order of happening.
                              | Form:
                              | (Player name, Action, Amount) or
                              | (Player name, Action) if no amount needed (e.g. in case of Check)

   It also has properties about flop texture like:

   :ivar bool is_rainbow:
   :ivar bool is_monotone:
   :ivar bool is_triplet:
   :ivar bool has_pair:
   :ivar bool has_straightdraw:
   :ivar bool has_gutshot:

PokerStars
----------

.. autoclass:: poker.room.pokerstars.PokerStarsHandHistory


Full Tilt Poker
---------------

.. autoclass:: poker.room.fulltiltpoker.FullTiltPokerHandHistory

   PokerStars and Full Tilt hand histories are very similar, so parsing them is almost identical.
   There are small differences though.

   **Class specific**

   :ivar tournament_level:  ``None``
   :ivar buyin:             ``None``: it's not in the hand history, but the filename
   :ivar rake:              ``None``: also
   :ivar currency:          ``None``
   :ivar str table_name:    just a number, but str type

   **Extra**

   :ivar Decimal turn_pot:        pot size before turn
   :ivar int turn_num_players:    number of players seen the turn
   :ivar Decimal river_pot:       pot size before river
   :ivar int river_num_players:   number of players seen the river
   :ivar str tournament_name:     e.g. ``"$750 Guarantee"``, ``"$5 Sit & Go (Super Turbo)"``


PKR
---

.. autoclass:: poker.room.pkr.PKRHandHistory

  **Class specific**

  :ivar str table_name:   "#table_number - name_of_the_table"

  **Extra**

  :ivar str last_ident:    last hand id
  :ivar str money_type:    ``"R"`` for real money, ``"P"`` for play money
